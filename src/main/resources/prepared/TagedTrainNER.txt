The <START:gpe> U.S. <END> government is delivering more bad news on the country 's struggling economy , saying first time claims for unemployment benefits are at a 26-year high . The Labor Department report , issued <START:time> Thursday <END> , said the number of laid-off workers applying for benefits for the first time soared to 6,26,000 last week . Officials said the total number of workers receiving unemployment benefits is now close to 42833 million , another record . A comprehensive government report on unemployment is due out <START:time> Friday <END> . Economists surveyed by news organizations predict the nationwide jobless rate will rise three-tenths of a percent to hit 42921 percent . Despite the rising claims for unemployment insurance , <START:gpe> U.S. <END> companies are squeezing more productivity out of their shrinking workforces . A second Labor Department report <START:time> Thursday <END> said productivity - a measure of how much an employee produces per hour - rose more than three percent for the last three months of <START:time> 2008 <END> . At least 17 people , including seven children , were killed and more than 70 others wounded in an explosion <START:time> Monday <END> at a home used for religious education in <START:geo> Pakistan <END> 's <START:geo> Punjab <END> province . Officials in the <START:geo> Mian Channu <END> area said they believe the blast , which also flattened more than 20 nearby houses , was caused by a cache of explosives stored in the house . They said the rescuers were trying to recover people still trapped in the rubble . The house belongs to a <START:org> Muslim <END> cleric who has been accused of recruiting fighters for a banned militant group . It is unclear what triggered the blast , but local police searching through the debris say they found rocket launchers , grenades , and several suicide-bomber jackets . <START:gpe> Pakistani <END> <START:per> Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani <END> condemned the blast and ordered an inquiry into the incident . A <START:gpe> U.S. <END> immigration judge has denied bail for <START:per> Luis Posada Carriles <END> , an asylum-seeking former <START:org> CIA <END> operative from <START:geo> Cuba <END> . <START:gpe> U.S. <END> authorities arrested the 77-year-old <START:per> Posada Carriles <END> in <START:time> May <END> after he illegally entered the country through <START:geo> Mexico <END> . <START:per> Posada Carriles <END> is wanted in <START:geo> Venezuela <END> for his alleged role in a <START:time> 1976 <END> <START:gpe> Cuban <END> airliner bombing that killed 73 people . Some 20 years ago , a <START:gpe> Venezuelan <END> court acquitted him of a role in the bombing . He later escaped from prison while awaiting a new trial . In <START:time> May <END> , <START:gpe> U.S. <END> officials rejected a <START:gpe> Venezuelan <END> request for his arrest , citing a lack of evidence against the <START:gpe> Cuban <END> exile who holds <START:gpe> Venezuelan <END> citizenship . <START:gpe> Pakistani <END> <START:per> President Pervez Musharraf <END> has sought the support of <START:gpe> Pakistanis <END> in the fight against religious extremism and terrorism . He underlined the need of ridding the society of extremism and terrorism , saying they are hurting <START:gpe> Pakistan <END> 's image by their actions . In a broadcast address to the nation <START:time> Thursday <END> , <START:per> General Musharraf <END> promised """" stern action """" against those involved in the printing , publication and distribution of hate material , including newspapers , magazines , pamphlets , and audio and video material . He said no outlawed organization will be allowed to collect donations and action will be taken against those who preach hate in mosques . Some Western leaders have said <START:gpe> Pakistan <END> should do more to curb militancy , and that extremists were operating in Islamic schools , or madrassas . <START:per> General Musharraf <END> said all madrassas in <START:geo> Pakistan <END> must be registered with the government by the end of this year . <START:gpe> U.S. <END> health officials have called for updated quarantine procedures , including better access to airline and ship passenger lists , to protect <START:gpe> Americans <END> from infectious diseases , including bird flu . The changes , proposed by the <START:gpe> U.S. <END> <START:org> Centers for Disease Control <END> , would apply to planes and ships arriving from outside the <START:geo> United States <END> as well as some domestic flights . The <START:org> CDC <END> also called for giving <START:gpe> U.S. <END> health officials more authority to administer medical treatment and vaccinations to quarantined people . Health officials say the need for new regulations became apparent during the <START:time> 2003 <END> SARS , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak , when authorities found it difficult to get in touch with airline passengers who may have been exposed to the illness . The proposals come amid growing concern about the spread of bird flu , which has killed more than 60 people in <START:geo> Asia <END> since <START:time> 2003 <END> . <START:gpe> Pakistani <END> police have arrested four alleged members of an Islamic militant group in connection with the murder of a prominent <START:org> Shi'ite Muslim <END> cleric earlier this year .

The murder sparked sectarian violence that left at least 14 people dead . The official says the suspects belong to the <START:org> Sunni Muslim Lashkar-e-Jhangvi <END> and that they were plotting to attack <START:org> Shi'ite <END> events last week but changed their minds because of tight security . The banned group is accused of killing hundreds of <START:gpe> Pakistani <END> <START:org> Shi'ite Muslims <END> in recent years and is believed to have links to the <START:org> al-Qaida <END> terrorist network . The name """" <START:obj> Latvia <END> """" originates from the ancient <START:org> Latgalians <END> , one of four eastern <START:geo> Baltic <END> tribes that formed the ethnic core of the <START:gpe> Latvian <END> people ( ca. 8th - 12th centuries <START:time> A.D. <END> ) . The region subsequently came under the control of <START:gpe> Germans <END> , <START:gpe> Poles <END> , <START:gpe> Swedes <END> , and finally , <START:gpe> Russians <END> . A <START:gpe> Latvian <END> republic emerged following <START:event> World War I <END> , but it was annexed by the <START:gpe> USSR <END> in <START:time> 1940 <END> - an action never recognized by the <START:gpe> US <END> and many other countries . <START:gpe> Latvia <END> reestablished its independence in <START:time> 1991 <END> following the breakup of the <START:gpe> Soviet Union <END> . Although the last <START:gpe> Russian <END> troops left in <START:time> 1994 <END> , the status of the <START:gpe> Russian <END> minority ( some 30 % of the population ) remains of concern to <START:gpe> Moscow <END> . <START:gpe> Latvia <END> joined both <START:org> NATO <END> and the <START:org> EU <END> in the spring of <START:time> 2004 <END> . <START:gpe> Bolivia <END> is one of the poorest and least developed countries in <START:geo> Latin America <END> . Following a disastrous economic crisis during the early <START:time> 1980s <END> , reforms spurred private investment , stimulated economic growth , and cut poverty rates in the <START:time> 1990s <END> . The period <START:time> 2003 - 5 <END> was characterized by political instability , racial tensions , and violent protests against plans - subsequently abandoned - to export <START:gpe> Bolivia <END> 's newly discovered natural gas reserves to large northern hemisphere markets . In <START:time> 2005 <END> , the government passed a controversial hydrocarbons law that imposed significantly higher royalties and required foreign firms then operating under risk-sharing contracts to surrender all production to the state energy company in exchange for a predetermined service fee . After higher prices for mining and hydrocarbons exports produced a fiscal surplus in <START:time> 2008 <END> , the global recession in <START:time> 2009 <END> slowed growth . Nevertheless , <START:gpe> Bolivia <END> recorded the highest growth rate in <START:geo> South America <END> that year . During <START:time> 2010 <END> an increase in world commodity prices resulted in the biggest trade surplus in history . However , a lack of foreign investment in the key sectors of mining and hydrocarbons and higher food prices pose challenges for the <START:gpe> Bolivian <END> economy . Autonomy for the <START:gpe> Swazis <END> of southern <START:geo> Africa <END> was guaranteed by the <START:gpe> British <END> in the late 19th century independence was granted in <START:time> 1968 <END> .

A constitution came into effect in <START:time> 2006 <END> , but the legal status of political parties remains unclear . The <START:gpe> African <END> <START:org> United Democratic Party <END> tried unsuccessfully to register as an official political party in mid <START:time> 2006 <END> .

First colonized by the <START:gpe> Spanish <END> , the islands came under <START:gpe> British <END> control in the early <START:time> 19th century <END> . The islands ' sugar industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in <START:time> 1834 <END> . Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from <START:geo> India <END> between <START:time> 1845 <END> and <START:time> 1917 <END> , which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry . The discovery of oil on <START:geo> Trinidad <END> in <START:time> 1910 <END> added another important export . Independence was attained in <START:time> 1962 <END> . The country is one of the most prosperous in the <START:geo> Caribbean <END> thanks largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing . Tourism , mostly in <START:geo> Tobago <END> , is targeted for expansion and is growing . The government is coping with a rise in violent crime . A GOATHERD , driving his flock from their pasture at eventide , found some Wild Goats mingled among them , and shut them up together with his own for the night . The next day it snowed very hard , so that he could not take the herd to their usual feeding places , but was obliged to keep them in the fold . He gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive , but fed the strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay with him and of making them his own . When the thaw set in , he led them all out to feed , and the Wild Goats scampered away as fast as they could to the mountains . The Goatherd scolded them for their ingratitude in leaving him , when during the storm he had taken more care of them than of his own herd . One of them , turning about , said to him : """" That is the very reason why we are so cautious for if you yesterday treated us better than the Goats you have had so long , it is plain also that if others came after us , you would in the same manner prefer them to ourselves . """" Old friends can not with impunity be sacrificed for new ones . A KIND-HEARTED Physician sitting at the bedside of a patient afflicted with an incurable and painful disease , heard a noise behind him , and turning saw a cat laughing at the feeble efforts of a wounded mouse to drag itself out of the room . """" You cruel beast ! """" cried he . """" Why do n't you kill it at once , like a lady ? """" Rising , he kicked the cat out of the door , and picking up the mouse compassionately put it out of its misery by pulling off its head . Recalled to the bedside by the moans of his patient , the Kind-hearted Physician administered a stimulant , a tonic , and a nutrient , and went away . Kids these days , they grow up too quickly and know entirely too much too soon . I mean this one friend of mine was trying to get his boy into Nursery Rhymes .

The pontiff also repeated his concern that too few <START:geo> Catholics <END> are giving due reverence to the <START:time> Eucharist <END> or properly marking <START:time> Sunday <END> as the <START:org> Lord <END> 's <START:time> Day <END> .

Police in <START:geo> Pakistan <END> say at least five soldiers were killed in a suicide attack in the country 's northwestern <START:org> Swat Valley <END> . Security officials say a suicide bomber rammed his explosives-laden vehicle into a security checkpoint in the town of <START:org> Khawaza Kehla <END> <START:time> Saturday <END> . At least four soldiers were wounded . <START:geo> Pakistan <END> 's military launched an offensive in <START:org> Swat <END> and surrounding areas in late <START:time> April <END> after militants violated a peace deal and began advancing toward the capital , <START:geo> Islamabad <END> . Officials call the operation a success and say most of the <START:org> Taliban <END> insurgents have been driven from the region . However , <START:gpe> Pakistani <END> forces have encountered some lingering resistance . The military says eight militants were killed <START:time> Saturday <END> in a clash that erupted as soldiers searched another area of <START:org> Swat Valley <END> . Two others were detained . Elsewhere in northwestern <START:geo> Pakistan <END> , security officials say fighter jets targeted a suspected militant hideout in the <START:geo> South Waziristan <END> tribal region <START:time> Saturday <END> . <START:geo> Iran <END> 's top nuclear negotiator says <START:org> Tehran <END> will soon resume large-scale enrichment of uranium if <START:geo> Iran <END> is referred to the <START:org> United Nations Security Council <END> . <START:per> Ali Larijani <END> also told a news conference <START:time> Wednesday <END> that <START:geo> Iran <END> 's main enrichment plant is ready for use . He said all <START:geo> Iran <END> has to do is inform the <START:org> International Atomic Energy Agency <END> that it would be resuming operations . His comments come one day before the <START:org> IAEA <END> board meets in <START:geo> Vienna <END> . A draft resolution obtained by news agencies formally calls on the <START:org> IAEA <END> to report <START:geo> Iran <END> to the <START:org> U.N.

European and <START:geo> U.S. <END> leaders accuse <START:geo> Iran <END> of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . <START:geo> Iran <END> denies the charge . <START:org> U.S. <END> <START:per> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice <END> says the <START:per> Bush <END> administration has a strategy to """" assure victory """" in <START:geo> Iraq <END> . In testimony before the <START:org> Senate Foreign Relations Committee <END> , <START:per> Ms. Rice <END> said the plan is to clear out areas under insurgent control , hold those areas securely , and build durable , national <START:org> Iraqi <END> institutions . She said the <START:org> United States <END> will send in teams of diplomatic and military personnel working together to help <START:gpe> Iraqis <END> train police , and set up essential services . <START:per> Ms. Rice <END> 's testimony <START:time> Wednesday <END> comes just days after <START:gpe> Iraqis <END> voted in a referendum on a new constitution . Senators pressed the secretary for specifics , including when the 150-thousand <START:org> U.S. <END> troops in <START:geo> Iraq <END> might start coming home . The secretary refused to offer a timetable , saying any withdrawal depends on <START:gpe> Iraqi <END> forces being able to fight the insurgents independently . <START:gpe> English <END> and <START:gpe> Irish <END> colonists from <START:geo> St. Kitts <END> first settled on <START:geo> Montserrat <END> in <START:time> 1632 <END> the first <START:gpe> African <END> slaves arrived <START:time> three decades later <END> . The <START:gpe> British <END> and <START:gpe> French <END> fought for possession of the island for most of the <START:time> 18th century <END> , but it finally was confirmed as a <START:gpe> British <END> possession in <START:time> 1783 <END> . The island 's sugar plantation economy was converted to small farm landholdings in the <START:time> mid 19th century <END> . Much of this island was devastated and two-thirds of the population fled abroad because of the eruption of the <START:org> Soufriere Hills Volcano <END> that began on <START:time> 18 July 1995 <END> . <START:geo> Montserrat <END> has endured volcanic activity since , with the last eruption occurring in <START:time> July 2003 <END> . <START:geo> Georgia <END> 's economy sustained GDP growth of more than 10 % in <START:time> 2006 - 7 <END> , based on strong inflows of foreign investment and robust government spending . However , GDP growth slowed in <START:time> 2008 <END> following the <START:time> August 2008 <END> conflict with <START:org> Russia <END> , and turned negative in <START:time> 2009 <END> as foreign direct investment and workers ' remittances declined in the wake of the global financial crisis , but rebounded in <START:time> 2010 <END> . <START:geo> Georgia <END> 's main economic activities include the cultivation of agricultural products such as grapes , citrus fruits , and hazelnuts mining of manganese and copper and output of a small industrial sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages , metals , machinery , aircraft and chemicals . Areas of recent improvement include growth in the construction , banking services , and mining sectors , but reduced availability of external investment and the slowing regional economy are emerging risks . The country imports nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and oil products . It has sizeable hydropower capacity , a growing component of its energy supplies . <START:geo> Georgia <END> has overcome the chronic energy shortages and gas supply interruptions of the past by renovating hydropower plants and by increasingly relying on natural gas imports from <START:geo> Azerbaijan <END> instead of from <START:geo> Russia <END> . The construction on the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline , the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline , and the <START:org> Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad <END> are part of a strategy to capitalize on <START:geo> Georgia <END> 's strategic location between <START:geo> Europe <END> and <START:geo> Asia <END> and develop its role as a transit point for gas , oil and other goods . <START:geo> Georgia <END> has historically suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax revenues however , the government , since coming to power in <START:time> 2004 <END> , has simplified the tax code , improved tax administration , increased tax enforcement , and cracked down on petty corruption . However , the economic downturn of <START:time> 2008 - 9 <END> eroded the tax base and led to a decline in the budget surplus and an increase in public borrowing needs . The country is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on a determined effort to continue to liberalize the economy by reducing regulation , taxes , and corruption in order to attract foreign investment , but the economy faces a more difficult investment climate both domestically and internationally . After discarding socialist economic policies in the <START:org> mid-1990s , Madagascar <END> followed a World Bank- and IMF-led policy of privatization and liberalization that has been undermined since the start of the political crisis . This strategy placed the country on a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low level . Agriculture , including fishing and forestry , is a mainstay of the economy , accounting for more than one-fourth of <START:obj> GDP <END> and employing 80 % of the population . Exports of apparel have boomed in recent years primarily due to duty-free access to the <START:geo> US <END> . However , <START:org> Madagascar <END> 's failure to comply with the requirements of the <START:gpe> African <END> <START:org> Growth and Opportunity Act <END> ( <START:obj> AGOA <END> ) led to the termination of the country 's duty-free access in <START:time> January 2010 <END> . Deforestation and erosion , aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of fuel , are serious concerns . Former <START:per> President RAVALOMANANA <END> worked aggressively to revive the economy following the <START:time> 2002 <END> political crisis , which triggered a 12 % drop in GDP <START:time> that <END> year . The current political crisis which began in early <START:time> 2009 <END> has dealt additional blows to the economy . Tourism dropped more than 50 % in <START:time> 2009 <END> , compared with the <START:time> previous <END> year , and many investors are wary of entering the uncertain investment environment . Settled by both <START:org> Britain <END> and <START:org> France <END> during the <START:time> first half of <END> the <START:time> 19th century <END> , the island was made a <START:gpe> French <END> possession in <START:time> 1853 <END> . It served as a penal colony for <START:time> four decades <END> after <START:time> 1864 <END> . Agitation for independence during the <START:time> 1980s and <END> early <START:time> 1990s <END> ended in the <START:time> 1998 Noumea Accord <END> , which over a period of <START:time> 15 <END> to <START:time> 20 <END> years will transfer an increasing amount of governing responsibility from <START:org> France <END> to <START:geo> New Caledonia <END> . The agreement also commits <START:org> France <END> to conduct a referendum <START:time> between 2014 <END> and <START:time> 2019 <END> to decide whether <START:geo> New Caledonia <END> should assume full sovereignty and independence . ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share which they each had in the affairs of mankind for the Ills by reason of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth . The Goods wafted themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous vengeance on their persecutors . They entreated <START:per> Jupiter <END> that they might no longer be associated with the Ills , as they had nothing in common and could not live together , but were engaged in unceasing warfare and that an indissoluble law might be laid down for their future protection . <START:per> Jupiter <END> granted their request and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in company with each other , but that the Goods should one by one enter the habitations of men . Hence it arises that <START:obj> Ills <END> abound , for they come not one by one , but in troops , and by no means singly : while the Goods proceed from <START:per> Jupiter <END> , and are given , not alike to all , but singly , and separately and one by one to those who are able to discern them . <START:gpe> Turkish <END> security officials say Kurdish rebels have killed 13 <START:gpe> Turkish <END> soldiers in a southeastern province near the border with <START:geo> Iraq <END> .

It became a Soviet satellite state following the war , but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive . Labor turmoil in <START:time> 1980 <END> led to the formation of the independent trade union """" Solidarity """" that over time became a political force and by <START:time> 1990 <END> had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency . A """" shock therapy """" program during the early <START:time> 1990s <END> enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in <START:geo> Central Europe <END> , but <START:gpe> Poland <END> still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment , underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure , and a poor rural underclass . <START:org> Poland <END> joined <START:org> NATO <END> in <START:time> 1999 <END> and the <START:org> European Union <END> in <START:time> 2004 <END> . With its transformation to a democratic , market-oriented country largely completed , <START:gpe> Poland <END> is an increasingly active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations .

Within the <START:org> EU <END> , <START:gpe> Denmark <END> is among the strongest supporters of trade liberalization . After a long consumption-driven upswing , <START:gpe> Denmark <END> 's economy began slowing in <START:time> 2007 <END> with the end of a housing boom . Housing prices dropped markedly in <START:time> 2008 - 9 <END> . The global financial crisis has exacerbated this cyclical slowdown through increased borrowing costs and lower export demand , consumer confidence , and investment .

Historically low levels of unemployment rose sharply with the recession but remain below 5 % , based on the national measure , about half the level of the <START:org> EU <END> harmonized to <START:org> OECD <END> standards the unemployment rate was about 8 % at the <START:time> end of 2010 <END> . <START:gpe> Denmark <END> made a modest recovery in <START:time> 2010 <END> in part because of increased government spending . An impending decline in the ratio of workers to retirees will be a major long-term issue . <START:gpe> Denmark <END> maintained a healthy budget surplus for many years up to <START:time> 2008 <END> , but the budget balance swung into deficit during <START:time> 2009 - 10 <END> . Nonetheless , <START:gpe> Denmark <END> 's fiscal position remains among the strongest in the <START:org> EU <END> . Despite previously meeting the criteria to join the <START:org> European Economic and Monetary Union <END> ( <START:org> EMU <END> ) , so far <START:gpe> Denmark <END> has decided not to join , although the <START:gpe> Danish <END> krone remains pegged to the euro .

Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues , and the shortfall is made up by critically needed grants from <START:geo> New Zealand <END> that are used to pay wages to public employees . <START:org> Niue <END> has cut government expenditures by reducing the public service by <START:time> almost half <END> . The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening , although some cash crops are grown for export . Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit , lime oil , honey , and coconut cream . The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue . The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population because of emigration to <START:geo> New Zealand <END> . Efforts to increase GDP include the promotion of tourism and financial services , although the <START:org> International Banking Repeal Act <END> of <START:time> 2002 <END> resulted in the termination of all offshore banking licenses . Economic aid from <START:geo> New Zealand <END> in <START:geo> FY08/09 <END> was US $ 42862 million . <START:org> Niue <END> suffered a devastating typhoon in <START:time> January 2004 <END> , which decimated nascent economic programs . While in the process of rebuilding , <START:org> Niue <END> has been dependent on foreign aid . <START:gpe> British <END> influence and control over what would become <START:geo> Nigeria <END> and <START:geo> Africa <END> 's most populous country grew through the <START:time> 19th century <END> . A series of constitutions after World War <START:event> II <END> granted <START:geo> Nigeria <END> greater autonomy independence came in <START:time> 1960 <END> . Following nearly <START:time> 16 <END> years of military rule , a new constitution was adopted in <START:time> 1999 <END> , and a peaceful transition to civilian government was completed . The government continues to face the daunting task of reforming a petroleum-based economy , whose revenues have been squandered through corruption and mismanagement , and institutionalizing democracy . In addition , <START:geo> Nigeria <END> continues to experience longstanding ethnic and religious tensions . Although both the <START:time> 2003 <END> and <START:time> 2007 <END> presidential elections were marred by significant irregularities and violence , <START:geo> Nigeria <END> is currently experiencing its longest period of civilian rule since independence . The general elections of <START:time> April 2007 <END> marked the first civilian-to-civilian transfer of power in the country 's history . In <START:time> January 2010 <END> , <START:geo> Nigeria <END> assumed a nonpermanent seat on the <START:org> UN Security Council <END> for the <START:time> 2010 <END> - <START:time> 11 term <END> . <START:org> Britain <END> conquered <START:org> Burma <END> over a <START:time> period of 62 <END> years ( <START:time> 1824 - 1886 <END> ) and incorporated it into its <START:gpe> Indian <END> Empire . <START:org> Burma <END> was administered as a province of <START:geo> India <END> until <START:time> 1937 <END> when it became a separate , self-governing colony independence from the <START:org> Commonwealth <END> was attained in <START:time> 1948 <END> . <START:per> Gen. NE WIN <END> dominated the government from <START:time> 1962 to 1988 <END> , first as military ruler , then as self-appointed president , and later as political kingpin . In <START:time> September 1988 <END> , the military deposed <START:per> NE WIN <END> and established a new ruling junta . Despite multiparty legislative elections in <START:time> 1990 <END> that resulted in the main opposition party - the <START:org> National League for Democracy <END> ( <START:org> NLD <END> ) - winning a landslide victory , the junta refused to hand over power . <START:org> NLD <END> leader and <START:org> Nobel Peace Prize <END> recipient AUNG SAN SUU KYI , who was under house arrest from <START:time> 1989 to 1995 and 2000 to 2002 <END> , was imprisoned in <START:time> May 2003 <END> and subsequently transferred to house arrest . She was finally released in <START:time> November 2010 <END> . After the ruling junta in <START:time> August 2007 <END> unexpectedly increased fuel prices , tens of thousands of <START:gpe> Burmese <END> marched in protest , led by prodemocracy activists and Buddhist monks . In late <START:time> September 2007 <END> , the government brutally suppressed the protests , killing at least 13 people and arresting thousands for participating in the demonstrations . Since then , the regime has continued to raid homes and monasteries and arrest persons suspected of participating in the pro-democracy protests . <START:geo> Burma <END> in early <START:time> May 2008 <END> was struck by <START:org> Cyclone Nargis <END> , which claimed over 1,38,000 dead and tens of thousands injured and homeless . Despite this tragedy , the junta proceeded with its <START:time> May <END> constitutional referendum , the first vote in <START:geo> Burma <END> <START:time> since 1990 <END> . Parliamentary elections held in <START:time> November 2010 <END> , considered flawed by many in the international community , saw the junta 's <START:org> Union Solidarity and Development Party <END> garnering over 75 % of the seats . <START:org> Parliament <END> convened in <START:time> January 2011 <END> and selected former <START:per> Prime <END> Minister THEIN SEIN as president . The vast majority of national-level appointees named by THEIN SEIN are former or current military officers . <START:org> Grenada <END> relies on tourism as its main source of foreign exchange especially since the construction of an international airport in <START:time> 1985 <END> . <START:org> Hurricanes Ivan <END> ( <START:time> 2004 <END> ) and Emily ( <START:time> 2005 <END> ) severely damaged the agricultural sector - particularly nutmeg and cocoa cultivation - which had been a key driver of economic growth . <START:org> Grenada <END> has rebounded from the devastating effects of the hurricanes but is now saddled with the debt burden from the rebuilding process . <START:per> Public debt-to-GDP <END> is nearly 110 % , leaving the <START:org> THOMAS <END> administration limited room to engage in public investments and social spending . Strong performances in construction and manufacturing , together with the development of tourism and an offshore financial industry , have also contributed to growth in national output however , economic growth was stagnant in <START:time> 2010 <END> after a sizeable contraction in <START:time> 2009 <END> , because of the global economic slowdown 's effects on tourism and remittances . One day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found there an egg all yellow and glittering . When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away , because he thought a trick had been played upon him . But he took it home on second thoughts , and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold . <START:time> Every morning <END> the same thing occurred , and he soon became rich by selling his eggs . As he grew rich he grew greedy and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give , he killed it and opened it only to find nothing . Greed oft o'er reaches itself . A Doe had had the misfortune to lose one of her eyes , and could not see any one approaching her on that side . So to avoid any danger she always used to feed on a high cliff near the sea , with her sound eye looking towards the land . By this means she could see whenever the hunters approached her on land , and often escaped by this means . But the hunters found out that she was blind of one eye , and hiring a boat rowed under the cliff where she used to feed and shot her from the sea . """" Ah , """" cried she with her dying voice , """" You can not escape your fate . """" A WOLF followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not attempt to injure one of them . The Shepherd at first stood on his guard against him , as against an enemy , and kept a strict watch over his movements . But when the Wolf , day after day , kept in the company of the sheep and did not make the slightest effort to seize them , the Shepherd began to look upon him as a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it and when occasion called him one day into the city , he left the sheep entirely in his charge . The Wolf , now that he had the opportunity , fell upon the sheep , and destroyed the greater part of the flock . When the Shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed , he exclaimed : """" I have been rightly served why did I trust my sheep to a Wolf ? ' Documents released by the <START:org> White House <END> show that the <START:org> Democratic National Committee <END> asked <START:per> Al Gore <END> to make 140 calls to campaign donors , but he only connected on 56 of them . The other 84 hung up because he sounds just like a dial tone . When <START:org> NASA <END> first started sending up astronauts , they quickly discovered that ball-point pens would not work in zero gravity . To combat this problem , <START:org> NASA <END> scientists spent a <START:time> decade <END> and $ 12 billion developing a pen that writes in zero gravity , upside down , underwater , on almost any surface including glass and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over 300 ˇC . The <START:gpe> Russians <END> use a pencil . <START:gpe> Krygyz <END> <START:per> President Kurmanbek Bakiyev <END> says he is ready for any new proposals from the <START:gpe> U.S. <END> government to stabilize the situation in <START:geo> Afghanistan <END> . <START:per> Mr. Bakiyev <END> made his comments to the <START:org> British Broadcasting Corporation <END> <START:time> Wednesday <END> . But <START:gpe> Kyrgyz <END> officials said <START:time> Thursday <END> the government will not reverse its decision to evict <START:gpe> U.S. <END> forces from a key military base that supports Western troops in <START:geo> Afghanistan <END> . Last week , <START:gpe> Kyrgyzstan <END> ordered <START:gpe> U.S. <END> forces to leave the <START:geo> Manas <END> air base within six months after <START:per> President Bakiyev <END> signed the decision into law . <START:gpe> U.S. <END> <START:per> Defense Secretary Robert Gates <END> said he believes the issue is not """" closed , """" and that the <START:geo> U.S. <END> will try to reach a new agreement with <START:org> Kyrgyzstan <END> . As an alternative , <START:per> Gates <END> said the <START:gpe> U.S. <END> is considering other supply routes . <START:geo> Manas Air Base <END> is currently the only <START:gpe> U.S. <END> military supply route in <START:geo> Central Asia <END> . A top <START:gpe> U.S. <END> military officer said <START:gpe> Tajikistan <END> and <START:gpe> Uzbekistan <END> have agreed to allow the transit of non-lethal <START:gpe> U.S. <END> cargo through their territory to <START:geo> Afghanistan <END> . <START:gpe> Washington <END> also has received permission from <START:gpe> Russia <END> and <START:gpe> Kazakhstan <END> to send supplies to <START:geo> Afghanistan <END> by rail . <START:per> President Bakiyev <END> had complained that <START:gpe> Washington <END> was not paying enough rent for the base . He announced plans to close it after <START:gpe> Russia <END> pledged to give <START:gpe> Kyrgyzstan <END> about $ 2 billion in loans and aid . Most <START:gpe> U.S. <END> and <START:org> NATO <END> shipments into <START:geo> Afghanistan <END> have been arriving by road through <START:geo> Pakistan <END> , but those convoys have increasingly come under attack from <START:org> Taliban <END> and <START:org> al-Qaida <END> militants . <START:gpe> Palestinian <END> security officials say a clash between <START:gpe> Israeli <END> troops and <START:gpe> Palestinian <END> militants near the <START:org> West Bank <END> town of <START:geo> Jenin <END> has left three militants dead . The officials identified the victims as a local leader of the <START:org> Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades <END> and two members of <START:geo> Islamic Jihad <END> . They say the fighting erupted when <START:gpe> Israeli <END> troops raided <START:geo> Jenin <END> early <START:time> Thursday morning <END> . <START:time> Wednesday <END> , <START:geo> Israel <END> 's military warned it may bombard the <START:geo> Gaza Strip <END> town of <START:geo> Beit Hanoun <END> , if necessary , to stop <START:gpe> Palestinian <END> rocket fire into <START:geo> Israel <END> . The militants have been firing rockets from the area , despite earlier pledges to stop such attacks . In <START:geo> Washington <END> , a <START:org> State Department <END> spokesman <START:per> Sean McCormack <END> said <START:org> Secretary of State <END> <START:per> Condoleezza Rice <END> has been pressing both sides to end the violence .

A secular coalition led by <START:geo> Iraq <END> 's former prime minister has taken a slight lead in overall votes as ballot counting from parliamentary elections continues - but it remains behind in the key provincial tally .

The lead has repeatedly shifted between <START:per> Mr. Allawi <END> and <START:per> Prime <END> Minister Maliki since the <START:time> March 7 <END> vote . But <START:per> Mr. <END> <START:geo> Maliki <END> 's State of Law coalition is still ahead in seven of <START:geo> Iraq <END> 's 18 provinces - compared to five provinces held by <START:per> Mr. <END> <START:geo> Allawi <END> 's <START:geo> Iraqiya <END> alliance . Seats in <START:geo> Iraq <END> 's 325-member parliament are won according to how well a coalition does in a province , not according to the overall vote .

The <START:org> World Health Organization <END> says a massive shortfall of a key malaria drug will last well into next year , leaving poor countries with about half of what they need to fight the disease . The <START:org> WHO <END> says <START:gpe> Chinese <END> suppliers have not shipped enough of a key ingredient used to make anti-malaria drugs to companies which manufacture the combination therapy . The ingredient , called artemisinin , is extracted from a plant primarily grown in <START:geo> China <END> . The <START:org> WHO <END> says it will set up a system of priorities to deliver the drug to those who need it most . It says the combination therapy is the most effective way to fight the deadliest form of malaria , called falciparum .

Other groups have made similar comments . For its part , <START:geo> Israel <END> signaled it could ease military operations against <START:gpe> Palestinian <END> gunmen if they halt attacks against <START:gpe> Israelis <END> .

An independent kingdom for much of its long history , <START:geo> Korea <END> was occupied by <START:geo> Japan <END> beginning in <START:time> 1905 <END> following the Russo-Japanese War . <START:time> Five <END> years <START:time> later <END> , <START:geo> Japan <END> formally annexed the entire peninsula . Following <START:event> World War II <END> , <START:gpe> Korea <END> was split with the northern half coming under Soviet-sponsored Communist control . After failing in the <START:event> Korean War <END> ( <START:time> 1950 - 53 <END> ) to conquer the <START:geo> US-backed Republic <END> of <START:geo> Korea <END> ( <START:geo> ROK <END> ) in the southern portion by force , <START:geo> North Korea <END> ( <START:geo> DPRK <END> ) , under its founder <START:per> President KIM Il Sung <END> , adopted a policy of ostensible diplomatic and economic """" self-reliance """" as a check against outside influence . The <START:org> DPRK <END> demonized the <START:geo> US <END> as the ultimate threat to its social system through state-funded propaganda , and molded political , economic , and military policies around the core ideological objective of eventual unification of <START:geo> Korea <END> under <START:per> Pyongyang <END> 's control . <START:per> KIM Il Sung <END> 's son , the current ruler <START:per> KIM Jong Il <END> , was officially designated as his father 's successor in <START:time> 1980 <END> , assuming a growing political and managerial role until the elder <START:per> KIM <END> 's death in <START:time> 1994 <END> . In <START:time> 2010 <END> , <START:per> KIM Jong Il <END> began the process of preparing the way for his youngest son , <START:org> KIM Jong Un <END> , to succeed him in power . After decades of economic mismanagement and resource misallocation , the <START:org> DPRK <END> since the <START:org> mid-1990s <END> has relied heavily on international aid to feed its population . <START:gpe> North Korea <END> 's history of regional military provocations , proliferation of military-related items , long-range missile development , <START:org> WMD <END> programs including tests of nuclear devices in <START:time> 2006 and 2009 <END> , and massive conventional armed forces are of major concern to the international community .

The <START:gpe> Czech <END> <START:geo> Republic <END> is a stable and prosperous market economy , which harmonized its laws and regulations with those of the <START:org> EU <END> prior to its <START:org> EU <END> accession in <START:time> 2004 <END> . While the conservative , inward looking <START:gpe> Czech <END> financial system has remained relative healthy , the small , open , export-driven <START:gpe> Czech <END> economy remains very sensitive to changes in the economic performance of its main export markets , especially <START:geo> Germany <END> . When <START:geo> Western Europe <END> and <START:geo> Germany <END> fell into recession in late <START:time> 2008 <END> , demand for <START:gpe> Czech <END> goods plunged , leading to double digit drops in industrial production and exports . As a result , real GDP fell 42826 % in <START:time> 2009 <END> , with most of the decline occurring during the <START:time> first quarter <END> . Real GDP , however , has slowly recovered with positive quarter-on-quarter growth starting in the <START:time> second half of 2009 <END> and continuing throughout <START:time> 2010 <END> . The auto industry remains the largest single industry and , together with its suppliers , accounts for as much as 20 % <START:time> of <END> <START:gpe> Czech <END> <START:time> manufacturing <END> . The <START:geo> Czech Republic <END> produced more than a million cars for the <START:time> first time in 2010 <END> , over 80 % of which were exported . Foreign and domestic businesses alike voice concerns about corruption , especially in public procurement . Other long term challenges include dealing with a rapidly aging population , funding an unsustainable pension and health care system , and diversifying away from manufacturing and toward a more high-tech , services-based , knowledge economy .

AN OWL , in her wisdom , counseled the Birds that when the acorn first began to sprout , to pull it all up out of the ground and not allow it to grow . She said acorns would produce mistletoe , from which an irremediable poison , the bird-lime , would be extracted and by which they would be captured . The Owl next advised them to pluck up the seed of the flax , which men had sown , as it was a plant which boded no good to them . And , lastly , the Owl , seeing an archer approach , predicted that this man , being on foot , would contrive darts armed with feathers which would fly faster than the wings of the Birds themselves . The Birds gave no credence to these warning words , but considered the Owl to be beside herself and said that she was mad . But afterwards , finding her words were TRUE , they wondered at her knowledge and deemed her to be the wisest of birds . Hence it is that when she appears they look to her as knowing all things , while she no longer gives them advice , but in solitude laments their past folly .

Under the new law , the <START:org> Kremlin <END> would select gubernatorial candidates , whose appointments would require confirmation by regional lawmakers . If a provincial parliament rejects a governor chosen by <START:time> Moscow <END> , the new law says <START:per> Mr. <END> <START:org> Putin <END> has the authority to dissolve that legislature . <START:gpe> French <END> <START:per> President Jacques Chirac <END> is preparing for a high-profile television appearance to try to boost uncertain prospects for <START:gpe> French <END> ratification of the <START:org> European Union <END> constitution . <START:per> Mr. Chirac <END> will open his public campaign for the constitution this <START:time> Thursday <END> evening in a televised debate with an audience of 80 young voters . His appearance follows a string of opinion polls that have shown <START:gpe> French <END> voters planning to reject the constitution in a referendum on <START:time> May 29 <END> . Pollsters say opponents plan to vote against the constitution to highlight their fear of <START:gpe> Turkish <END> <START:org> EU <END> membership or to register their discontent with <START:per> Mr. Chirac <END> 's socio-economic policies . Some critics say the constitution could cost <START:gpe> French <END> jobs and destroy the country 's social welfare system . The constitution , aimed at streamlining <START:org> EU decision-making <END> , requires ratification by all of the union 's 25 member states to take effect . World oil prices soared to yet another record high in <START:time> Thursday <END> 's trading , increasing the threat of inflation and dimming prospects for global economic growth . The price of crude oil for future delivery went as high as $ 145.85 a barrel in <START:geo> New York <END> trading . Analysts blamed the price hikes on a weak <START:geo> U.S. <END> dollar , concerns about conflict in the <START:geo> Middle East <END> , and lower crude oil inventories . Raising the price of oil boosts the cost of making many goods and increases the cost of delivering everything , so soaring energy costs are increasing the threat of inflation . <START:time> Thursday <END> , the <START:org> European Central Bank <END> tried to fight inflation by raising interest rates a quarter of a point to 42850 percent . Increasing interest rates slows the economy by raising the cost of borrowing money to buy equipment to expand businesses or purchase homes . <START:org> Zimbabwe <END> is preparing to nullify thousands of legal challenges by white farmers who had their land seized under the country 's controversial land reform program . A report in <START:geo> Zimbabwe <END> 's <START:time> Sunday Mail <END> newspaper says authorities will file court papers <START:time> Monday <END> to officially end the litigation under a new constitutional amendment that nationalizes all seized farms and bans any legal challenges . An official in the attorney general 's office says 4 cases pending before the courts will be nullified . <START:per> President Robert Mugabe <END> began the land seizures in <START:time> 2000 <END> and transferred ownership to landless blacks . <START:per> Mr. Mugabe <END> says the land seizures were necessary to correct ownership imbalances created under <START:gpe> British <END> colonial rule . But critics say the program has been a failure and has led to the collapse of <START:geo> Zimbabwe <END> 's economy . A court in <START:geo> Venezuela <END> has ordered four people detained for their alleged involvement in the assassination of a leading government prosecutor . Those ordered held by the court <START:time> Friday <END> include newspaper editor <START:per> Patricia Poleo <END> and businessman <START:per> Nelson Mezerhane <END> . They are accused of plotting the assassination of <START:geo> Danilo Anderson <END> , who was leading the prosecution of hundreds of people accused of backing a <START:time> 2002 <END> coup against <START:per> President Hugo Chavez <END> . <START:per> Mr. Anderson <END> was killed by a car bomb last <START:time> November <END> . <START:per> Ms. Poleo <END> and <START:per> Mr. Mezerhane <END> are accused of plotting the assassination with two others who have been detained - retired general <START:org> Eugenio Anez Nunez <END> and <START:per> Salvador Romani <END> , a <START:gpe> Cuban <END> dissident . Since <START:per> Mr. Anderson <END> 's killing last year , <START:gpe> Venezuelan <END> police have arrested at least two other suspects , while two others were killed in a gunfight with police . <START:gpe> Pakistani <END> <START:per> Prime <END> Minister <START:per> Yousuf Raza Gilani <END> has arrived in the country 's southern port city of <START:geo> Karachi <END> to try to quell unrest that has killed at least 85 people . <START:time> Monday <END> 's assassination of provincial lawmaker <START:per> Raza Haider <END> triggered four days of riots , with protesters opening fire and burning vehicles and shops . <START:per> Haider <END> was a member of the <START:org> Muttahida Quami Movement <END> or <START:org> MQM <END> , which is part of the ruling political coalition in both <START:geo> Sindh <END> province and the federal government . The party , which largely represents the Urdu-speaking community , and the <START:org> Awami National Party <END> or <START:org> ANP <END> , which represents ethnic Pashtuns , have blamed each other for the violence . <START:geo> Pakistan <END> 's <START:geo> Interior <END> Minister <START:per> Rehman Malik <END> has said Taliban-linked militants looking to fuel political tensions were behind <START:per> Haider <END> 's assassination . <START:per> Malik <END> met with representatives from both the <START:org> MQM <END> and <START:org> ANP <END> on <START:time> Friday <END> . Political leaders were due to meet with <START:per> Prime <END> Minister <START:per> Gilani <END> later in the <START:time> day <END> . <START:org> Pakistan and India <END> have ushered in the <START:time> new <END> year by exchanging lists of their civilian nuclear facilities . <START:org> Pakistan 's Foreign Ministry <END> <START:time> Tuesday <END> said the two countries participated in the annual exchange , as part of a <START:time> 1998 <END> agreement prohibiting attacks on each other 's nuclear installations . The lists of nuclear facilities were handed over at <START:org> India and Pakistan 's <END> respective foreign ministries in <START:geo> New Delhi <END> and <START:geo> Islamabad <END> . <START:org> India and Pakistan <END> have fought three wars since partition in <START:time> 1947 <END> . But relations have improved since the two countries launched a slow moving peace process in <START:time> 2004 <END> to resolve their disputes , including the conflict over <START:geo> Kashmir <END> . <START:org> India and Pakistan <END> both conducted nuclear weapons tests in <START:time> 1998 <END> . The <START:org> White House <END> says <START:per> President Bush <END> will make an evening address to the nation on <START:time> Monday <END> , the <START:time> fifth anniversary of <END> the <START:time> September 11 <END> attacks on the <START:geo> United States <END> . It will be the latest in a series of speeches about terrorism that the <START:per> President <END> has made in the <START:time> past two <END> weeks . He has been highlighting what he calls the nation 's progress in the war on terrorism , ahead of key midterm elections in <START:time> November <END> . A presidential spokesman said <START:time> Friday <END> that <START:per> Mr. Bush <END> 's speech will be non-political and will focus on what the <START:time> September 11 <END> attacks have meant to the nation . On <START:time> Sunday <END> and <START:time> Monday <END> the president is scheduled to visit the sites of the attacks in <START:geo> New York City <END> , <START:geo> Shanksville <END> , <START:geo> Pennsylvania <END> and the <START:org> Pentagon <END> in <START:geo> Washington <END> . Democrats accuse <START:per> Mr. Bush <END> of emphasizing anti-terror efforts lately to distract from the increasingly unpopular war in <START:geo> Iraq <END> . The foreign relations committee of <START:geo> Pakistan <END> 's upper house of parliament has condemned what it called the <START:gpe> Israeli <END> """" aggression """" on <START:geo> Lebanon <END> and urged the international community to pressure the Jewish state to halt the strikes . The demand came through a unanimously adopted resolution at a special session of the <START:org> Senate <END> committee held in <START:geo> Islamabad <END> . <START:gpe> Pakistan <END> has no diplomatic relations with <START:geo> Israel <END> . Some 800 <START:gpe> Pakistani <END> students staged demonstrations in the southern port city of <START:geo> Karachi <END> to protest against the <START:gpe> Israeli <END> action . In neighboring <START:geo> Bangladesh <END> , Foreign <START:per> Minister M. Morshed Khan <END> urged Western countries """" to restrain <START:geo> Israel <END> """" from such attacks and said many Western countries use a double standard in dealing with the <START:geo> Middle East <END> . <START:gpe> Japanese <END> <START:per> Prime <END> Minister <START:per> Junichiro Koizumi <END> launched his political campaign <START:time> Saturday <END> for the snap general election he has called on <START:time> September 11 <END> . The prime minister says the focal point of the election will be his proposal for privatization of <START:geo> Japan <END> 's national postal system , a sprawling business empire that includes savings institutions with three trillion dollars in assets . <START:per> Mr. Koizumi <END> dissolved <START:org> Parliament <END> and called a general election about <START:time> two <END> weeks ago after <START:geo> Japan <END> 's upper house voted down postal reforms - with members of the ruling <START:org> Liberal Democratic Party <END> joining the majority . <START:org> LDP <END> leaders have withdrawn support for lawmakers who voted """" no """" on <START:time> August 8 <END> , and say they will not be allowed to run for re-election . A <START:org> Yomiuri <END> newspaper poll this week shows support for <START:per> Mr. Koizumi <END> has risen to 19391 percent , up 42860 percentage points since he dissolved <START:org> Parliament <END> . Presidents from most South <START:gpe> American <END> countries have gathered in <START:geo> Brazil <END> for a meeting of the <START:geo> Mercosur <END> trading group . The <START:time> two-day <END> meeting in <START:geo> Rio de Janeiro <END> began <START:time> Thursday <END> . One of the main issues under discussion is how to make <START:geo> Mercosur <END> more responsive to the social concerns of the member countries . The push for a change of direction for the five-member alliance is coming from <START:geo> Venezuela <END> 's leftist <START:per> President Hugo Chavez <END> . <START:gpe> Ecuador <END> and <START:gpe> Bolivia <END> , both also led by leftist governments , are seeking to join the group . Officials say the trade bloc now accounts for one trillion dollars in annual economic activity and includes 250 million people . <START:gpe> Argentina <END> , <START:gpe> Brazil <END> , <START:gpe> Paraguay <END> and <START:gpe> Uruguay <END> formed <START:org> Mercosur <END> in <START:time> 1991 <END> . <START:geo> Venezuela <END> joined in <START:time> July of <END> last year . <START:gpe> Chile <END> and <START:gpe> Bolivia <END> are associate members . <START:gpe> Afghan <END> officials say <START:per> President Hamid Karzai <END> is considering offering a government post to a powerful regional warlord , despite concerns over his role in alleged human rights abuses . A presidential spokesman <START:per> Jawed Ludin <END> told a news briefing in <START:geo> Kabul <END> <START:time> Tuesday <END> that <START:per> General Abdul Rashid Dostum <END> held several meetings with the president to discuss a possible government position . Asked about charges that <START:per> General Dostum <END> was guilty of human rights abuses and war crimes , the spokesman said it was a completely different issue . He stressed that everyone in <START:geo> Afghanistan <END> has the right to fulfill their responsibilities and be given opportunity to do so . <START:per> General Dostum <END> 's faction helped U.S.-led coalition forces oust the former <START:org> Taleban <END> regime in <START:time> 2001 <END> . He finished fourth in last year 's presidential elections and narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in <START:time> January <END> . Economic activity is limited to providing services to military personnel and contractors located on the island . All food and manufactured goods must be imported . Financial services - banking , fund management , insurance - account for about 23 % of employment and about 55 % of total income in this tiny , prosperous <START:geo> Channel Island <END> economy . Tourism , manufacturing , and horticulture , mainly tomatoes and cut flowers , have been declining . Financial services , construction , retail , and the public sector have been growing . Light tax and death duties make <START:geo> Guernsey <END> a popular tax haven . The evolving economic integration of the <START:org> EU <END> nations is changing the environment under which <START:geo> Guernsey <END> operates . The <START:gpe> Jamaican <END> economy is heavily dependent on services , which now account for more than 60 % of GDP . The country continues to derive most of its foreign exchange from tourism , remittances , and bauxite / alumina . Remittances account for nearly 15 % of GDP and exports of bauxite and alumina make up about 10 % . The bauxite / alumina sector was most affected by the global downturn while the tourism industry was resilient , experiencing an increase of 4 % in tourist arrivals . Tourism revenues account for roughly 10 % of GDP , and both arrivals and revenues grew in <START:time> 2010 <END> , up 4 % and 6 % respectively . The Economic growth faces many challenges : high crime and corruption , large-scale unemployment and underemployment , and a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120 % . <START:geo> Jamaica <END> 's onerous public debt burden - the fourth highest in the world on a per capita basis - is the result of government bailouts to ailing sectors of the economy , most notably to the financial sector in the mid-to-late <START:time> 1990s <END> . In early <START:time> 2010 <END> , the <START:gpe> Jamaican <END> government created the <START:org> Jamaica Debt Exchange <END> ( <START:org> JDX <END> ) in order to retire high-priced domestic bonds and significantly reduce annual debt servicing . The Government of <START:org> Jamaica <END> signed a $ 42762 billion , <START:org> 27-month Standby Agreement <END> with the <START:org> International Monetary Fund <END> for balance of payment support in <START:time> February 2010 <END> . Other multilaterals have also provided millions of dollars in loans and grants . Despite the improvement , debt servicing costs still hinder the government 's ability to spend on infrastructure and social programs , particularly as job losses rise in a shrinking economy . The <START:org> GOLDING <END> administration faces the difficult prospect of having to achieve fiscal discipline in order to maintain debt payments , while simultaneously attacking a serious crime problem that is hampering economic growth . High unemployment exacerbates the crime problem , including gang violence that is fueled by the drug trade . Since the <START:time> 1960s <END> , <START:geo> South Korea <END> has achieved an incredible record of growth and global integration to become a high-tech industrialized economy . Four decades ago , GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of <START:geo> Africa <END> and <START:geo> Asia <END> . In <START:time> 2004 <END> , <START:geo> South Korea <END> joined the trillion dollar club of world economies , and currently is among the world 's 20 largest economies . Initially , a system of close government and business ties , including directed credit and import restrictions , made this success possible . The government promoted the import of raw materials and technology at the expense of consumer goods , and encouraged savings and investment over consumption . The Asian financial crisis of <START:time> 1997 - 98 <END> exposed longstanding weaknesses in <START:geo> South Korea <END> 's development model including high debt / equity ratios and massive short-term foreign borrowing . GDP plunged by 42895 % in <START:time> 1998 <END> , and then recovered by 9 % in <START:time> 1999 - 2000 <END> . <START:geo> Korea <END> adopted numerous economic reforms following the crisis , including greater openness to foreign investment and imports . Growth moderated to about <START:time> 4 - 5 <END> % annually <START:time> between 2003 and 2007 <END> . With the global economic downturn in late <START:time> 2008 <END> , South <START:gpe> Korean <END> GDP growth slowed to 0.2 % in <START:time> 2009 <END> . In the <START:time> third quarter of 2009 <END> , the economy began to recover , in large part due to export growth , low interest rates , and an expansionary fiscal policy , and growth exceeded 6 % in <START:time> 2010 <END> . The South <START:gpe> Korean <END> economy 's long term challenges include a rapidly aging population , inflexible labor market , and overdependence on manufacturing exports to drive economic growth . Officials in <START:geo> Afghanistan <END> say <START:org> Taleban <END> , <START:org> al-Qaida <END> and hundreds of other inmates at a high-security prison in <START:geo> Kabul <END> have taken control of a prison block after clashing with security guards . Prison officials say the riot erupted <START:time> Saturday night <END> after a group of prisoners refused to wear new prison uniforms intended to prevent inmates from mingling with visitors and possibly escaping . Seven <START:org> Taleban <END> inmates used such a method to escape last month . Officials say at least 1,3 prisoners were involved in the riot . Shots were heard at the <START:obj> Pul-e-Charkhi <END> prison <START:time> Saturday <END> and early <START:time> Sunday <END> . Authorities say no guards were hurt , but several prisoners were injured . <START:obj> Pul-e-Charkhi <END> prison is a huge facility built in the <START:time> 1970s <END> where thousands of <START:gpe> Afghans <END> opposing communist rule in the <START:time> 1980s <END> were tortured and killed . The prison now holds common criminals as well as <START:org> al-Qaida <END> and Taleban-linked militants . Witnesses in <START:geo> Somalia <END> 's capital say an exchange of mortar fire has killed at least seven people and injured 12 others . Residents say <START:time> Wednesday <END> 's fighting began when an <START:geo> African Union <END> plane landed at <START:geo> Mogadishu <END> 's main airport in defiance of a ban by the <START:org> Islamist <END> militant group <START:org> al-Shabab <END> . The insurgents fired mortars at the airport , triggering a counter-attack . It is not clear whether those shells came from <START:geo> African Union <END> peacekeepers , <START:gpe> Ethiopian <END> troops , or <START:gpe> Somali <END> government forces . <START:org> Al-Shabab <END> warned last month that it would attack any planes landing or taking off from the airport . The group said the flights benefit <START:geo> Ethiopia <END> , which has thousands of troops in <START:geo> Somalia <END> backing the interim government . The <START:gpe> Somali <END> government has urged airlines to use the airport despite the threat . On at least two other occasions , <START:per> Islamists <END> fired on the facility after planes successfully landed . One of <START:geo> Iraq <END> 's top Sunni political groups has agreed to support a new constitution in <START:time> Saturday <END> 's referendum , after reaching a deal with negotiators to consider future changes to the draft . <START:geo> Iraq <END> 's <START:geo> Shi'ite <END> and Kurdish-dominated parliament is to discuss the deal at a special session <START:time> later Wednesday <END> . Late <START:time> Tuesday <END> , <START:geo> Iraq <END> 's main <START:per> Sunni Arab <END> political party ( the <START:gpe> Iraqi <END> Islamic <START:org> Party <END> ) announced its support for the draft constitution , after <START:geo> Shi'ite <END> and <START:geo> Kurdish <END> negotiators agreed to allow <START:org> Parliament <END> to consider amendments to the constitution . It is unclear if other <START:per> Sunni <END> groups not involved in negotiations will reverse their calls for voters to reject the constitution . <START:geo> U.S. <END> officials have also been pressing Sunnis to back the constitution in the hope it will weaken the insurgency and enable the withdrawal of foreign troops . In <START:geo> Baghdad <END> <START:time> today <END> , <START:gpe> Iraqi <END> police say at least six people were injured when a suicide car bomber struck a government convoy . <START:org> U.S. <END> <START:per> Senator Trent Lott <END> has introduced a bill to re-establish the <START:org> Federal Emergency Management Agency <END> as an independent group reporting directly to the <START:per> President <END> . The Republican from <START:geo> Mississippi <END> says thousands of people in his state are still without enough help more than five months after Hurricane Katrina . He blamed the bureaucratic inefficiencies created when <START:org> FEMA <END> was placed under the <START:org> Department of Homeland Security <END> . <START:org> FEMA <END> was merged into the department in a massive federal restructuring after the <START:time> September 11 , 2001 <END> terrorist attacks . <START:per> Senator Lott <END> says he questioned the wisdom of the move at the time . Former <START:org> FEMA <END> Director <START:per> James Lee Witt <END> said <START:time> Thursday <END> that <START:org> FEMA <END> has become a disgrace since the merger . <START:per> Witt <END> , who headed the agency during the <START:geo> Clinton <END> administration , said the continued emphasis on terrorism has """" minimized and demoralized emergency management . """" Millions of striking workers brought parts of <START:geo> India <END> to a standstill <START:time> Tuesday <END> as they protested price hikes and alleged anti-labor policies . Leftist trade unions called the nationwide day-long strike to express building anger and frustration over the rising cost of living and plans by government to disinvest from public sector companies . The strikes , which only materialized in the eastern state of <START:geo> West Bengal <END> and the southwestern state of <START:geo> Kerala <END> , shut down schools , shops , banks and disrupted some airline flights . About one million bank employees joined in the work stoppage . <START:time> Tuesday <END> 's demonstrations come two months after main opposition parties led a <START:time> one-day <END> strike over fuel prices hikes , leaving some regions at a similar standstill . Inflation in <START:geo> India <END> has been nearing double digits in recent months . <START:org> Bulgaria <END> has extradited the nephew of former <START:gpe> Turkish <END> president <START:per> Suleyman Demirel <END> to <START:geo> Turkey <END> , where he is wanted for massive fraud . <START:per> Yahya Murat Demirel <END> and his wife , <START:per> Aysegul Esenler <END> , were arrested in the <START:org> Black Sea <END> port city of <START:geo> Bourgas <END> on <START:time> December 31 <END> when they tried to enter <START:geo> Bulgaria <END> illegally . <START:per> Mr. Demirel <END> had been forbidden by <START:gpe> Turkish <END> courts to leave the country , where he is on trial in connection with the collapse of <START:gpe> Turkish <END> Egebank , which he owned . He and his wife were delivered to <START:gpe> Turkish <END> authorities <START:time> Friday morning <END> . Campaigning draws to a close <START:time> Sunday <END> in <START:geo> Egypt <END> 's first <START:time> multi-candidate <END> presidential election . Incumbent <START:per> president Hosni Mubarak <END> , who faces nine rivals , is expected to hold a final rally of his ruling <START:geo> National Democratic <END> party <START:time> today before Wednesday <END> 's poll . Despite facing electoral opponents for the first time , <START:per> President Mubarak <END> is widely expected to win a fifth term . <START:per> Ayman Nour <END> , one of <START:per> Mr. Mubarak <END> 's most prominent opponents , addressed a crowd in the heart of <START:geo> Cairo <END> late <START:time> Saturday <END> after touring the country . <START:per> Mr. Nour <END> and his <START:geo> Ghad <END> party have led the most aggressive campaign , linking the <START:per> Mubarak <END> government to years of oppression , economic crisis , and joblessness . In <START:time> February <END> , <START:per> President Mubarak <END> proposed holding contested presidential elections to replace a system where parliament nominated a single candidate for approval in a referendum . The <START:geo> U.S. <END> military says rescue teams have reached the wreckage of a helicopter that went down <START:time> Tuesday <END> in <START:geo> eastern Afghanistan <END> , but there is still no word on the fate of the 17 <START:geo> U.S. <END> troops on board . A spokesman , <START:per> Lt. Col.

The government announced earlier this month that reporters will not be allowed at a bombing site for one hour following an attack . Reasons given for the ban include protecting reporters from secondary attacks and preserving evidence from attacks . However , the executive director of the <START:org> Committee <END> to <START:org> Protect Journalists , Joel Simon <END> , says the restriction appears to be an attempt to limit media coverage of unwelcome news .

At the close of <START:event> World War I <END> , the <START:gpe> Czechs <END> and <START:gpe> Slovaks <END> of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form <START:geo> Czechoslovakia <END> . During the interwar years , having rejected a federal system , the new country 's leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic , most notably the <START:org> Sudeten <END> <START:gpe> Germans <END> and the <START:org> Ruthenians <END> ( <START:org> Ukrainians <END> ) . On the eve of World War <START:event> II <END> , the <START:gpe> Czech <END> part of the country was forcibly annexed to the <START:org> Third Reich <END> , and the <START:gpe> Slovaks <END> declared independence as a fascist ally of <START:geo> Nazi Germany <END> .

This small , sub-Saharan economy suffers from anemic economic growth and depends heavily on both commercial and subsistence agriculture , which provides employment for 65 % of the labor force . Some basic foodstuffs must still be imported . Cocoa , coffee , and cotton generate about 40 % of export earnings with cotton being the most important cash crop . <START:org> Togo <END> is the world 's fourth-largest producer of phosphate . The government 's decade-long effort , supported by the <START:org> World Bank <END> and the <START:org> IMF <END> , to implement economic reform measures , encourage foreign investment , and bring revenues in line with expenditures has moved slowly .

Under the agreement , <START:geo> Japan <END> and the <START:geo> United States <END> will exchange information on research , deployment and operations of a missile shield . The agreement comes one week after <START:geo> Japan <END> adopted new defense policy guidelines that would allow the joint development of a missile defense system with the <START:geo> United States <END> . The five-year defense outline allows the sale of missile defense components to the <START:geo> United States <END> for production of a missile shield . <START:geo> Japan <END> says other arms export cases will be considered on a case-by-case basis . <START:gpe> Ethiopians <END> vote <START:time> Sunday <END> in a second round of elections for local government positions , despite an opposition boycott and criticism from a prominent international human rights group . The first round of voting was last <START:time> Sunday <END> . Opposition leaders claim that most of their candidates were disqualified from running or intimidated into dropping out . The ruling <START:org> EPRDF <END> party has denied those allegations , saying the electoral board registered every candidate who had the proper credentials . The rights group <START:org> Human Rights Watch <END> agrees with the opposition 's view , calling the elections """" a rubber stamp """" for the ruling party 's domination of power . Approximately four million seats in parliament , city councils and neighborhood councils are at stake in the elections . <START:geo> Ethiopia <END> has 26 million registered voters . The leader of the <START:org> Church of England <END> says the <START:org> British Broadcasting Corporation <END> should air an appeal for humanitarian aid for civilians in the <START:geo> Gaza Strip <END> . The <START:org> Archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams <END> , <START:time> Sunday <END> made his comments as more than 50 <START:gpe> British <END> lawmakers announced a petition urging the <START:org> BBC <END> to run the appeal . The <START:org> UK <END> 's national broadcaster says it rejected the appeal because it did not want to harm its image as an impartial news source . The <START:org> BBC <END> also questioned whether the aid will reach those who need it . The organization seeking to advertise its appeal , the <START:org> Disasters Emergency Committee , <END> is a grouping of 13 aid agencies that aid people in crisis . The group says it is not political , and that it is seeking funds to help innocent people affected by the conflict in <START:geo> Gaza <END> . Authorities in <START:geo> France <END> say they have arrested 13 <START:gpe> Turkish <END> Kurds on suspicion of helping to finance terrorism . Police say the Kurds are suspected of involvement in a money laundering network that funds the militant <START:org> Kurdistan Workers Party <END> , also known by the initials <START:org> PKK <END> . <START:gpe> Turkey <END> , the <START:geo> United States <END> and the <START:org> European Union <END> classify the <START:org> PKK <END> as a terrorist organization . Police say <START:time> Monday <END> 's arrests in the suburbs of the capital are part of an investigation that began last <START:time> July <END> when two Kurds were arrested in <START:geo> Paris <END> trying to exchange 2,00,000 euros ( about $ 2,60,000 ) in cash into other currencies .

Official preliminary results are expected to be released <START:time> later Thursday <END> . <START:org> Israel <END> , the <START:org> United States <END> and the <START:org> European Union <END> say they will not deal with any <START:gpe> Palestinian <END> government that includes <START:org> Hamas <END> unless the group disarms and agrees to recognize <START:geo> Israel <END> , something <START:org> Hamas <END> officials say they will not do . <START:geo> Thailand <END> 's military government has selected the head of the country 's <START:org> Constitution Drafting Council <END> in what is seen as a first step toward restoring democracy after last year 's military coup . Following his election to the council <START:time> Monday <END> , political science professor <START:org> Noranit Setabutr <END> said a new draft constitution would be completed <START:time> within 180 <END> days . He said the new constitution must be acceptable to the <START:gpe> Thai <END> public and bring about democracy . Members of <START:geo> Thailand <END> 's military overthrew the government of former <START:per> Prime <END> Minister <START:per> Thaksin Shinawatra <END> last <START:time> September <END> . They accused him of exploiting the old constitution to amass more personal power than his office afforded him . The coup leaders have promised to hold a general election under a new constitution <START:time> within <END> a year . <START:per> Mr. Thaksin <END> is living outside the country while he is being investigated for corruption and abuse of power at home . <START:gpe> Russian <END> <START:per> President Vladimir Putin <END> says he believes <START:geo> Iran <END> is cooperating sufficiently with the <START:org> United Nations <END> nuclear agency and <START:org> U.N. <END> sanctions will cause new problems . <START:per> Mr. Putin <END> 's remarks were broadcast <START:time> Sunday <END> on <START:gpe> American <END> television , but the interview was conducted <START:time> Friday <END> . The <START:gpe> Russian <END> leader said <START:geo> Iran <END> 's president told him he wanted continued negotiations with <START:geo> Britain <END> , <START:geo> France <END> and <START:geo> Germany <END> . The three European countries , backed by the <START:geo> United States <END> , have been trying to convince <START:geo> Iran <END> to suspend its nuclear fuel enrichment program . <START:geo> Russia <END> is helping <START:geo> Iran <END> build a new nuclear energy plant . Rescuers working at a flooded coal mine in central <START:geo> China <END> have recovered the bodies of 39 miners following an accident more than <START:time> two <END> weeks ago . The official <START:org> Xinhua <END> news agency said <START:time> Saturday <END> recovery teams are still searching for three miners missing and presumed dead . The miners have been trapped underground at the <START:org> Sigou Coal Mine <END> in <START:geo> Henan <END> province since <START:time> December 9 <END> , when a nearby river overflowed its banks and water rushed into the shaft . <START:org> Xinhua <END> says 10 mine officials have been detained and will face """" stern punishment """" for the accident . <START:geo> China <END> 's coal mines are the world 's deadliest , with more than 5 deaths reported every year in fires , floods and other disasters . The <START:gpe> Venezuelan <END> information ministry has dismissed criticism by the <START:org> Organization of American States <END> of proposed media legislation being debated in the <START:gpe> Venezuelan <END> <START:org> Congress <END> . An information ministry spokesman <START:time> Wednesday <END> said the <START:org> OAS <END> , which said the proposal may restrict freedom of expression and political dissent , should stop meddling in <START:geo> Venezuela <END> 's domestic political affairs . The proposed law bans vulgar language , depictions of alcohol and drug consumption , gambling , sex and violence during the daylight hours . It allows the government to shut down stations that show violence , and to impose 18-day jail sentences for broadcasting FALSE information . The ministry said the bill is in rigorous compliance with press freedoms guaranteed under the constitution and international treaties . The trial in <START:geo> Kosovo <END> of six ethnic <START:gpe> Albanians <END> suspected of war crimes has opened in the town of <START:geo> Gniljane <END> , southeast of the capital <START:geo> Pristina <END> . <START:geo> U.N. <END> police and NATO-led peacekeepers arrested former fighter with the <START:org> Kosovo Liberation Army <END> , <START:per> Selim Krasniqi <END> , and several of his associates last year in <START:geo> Prizren <END> . Five of the accused appeared in court and one is being tried in absentia . The defendants face charges of murder and other crimes against fellow ethnic <START:gpe> Albanians <END> during the conflict in <START:geo> Kosovo <END> in the late <START:time> 1990s <END> . The proceedings got underway about a week after gunmen shot and killed a witness in the case . At the time of his arrest , <START:per> Mr. Krasniqi <END> was a commander of the <START:org> Kosovo Protection Corps <END> , a post-war civil defense group that deals with emergencies in <START:geo> Kosovo <END> . Authorities say gunmen have abducted a <START:gpe> British <END> oil worker from a drilling rig off the coast of <START:geo> Nigeria <END> . A spokesman for the U.S.-based operator , <START:org> Transocean <END> , said the attackers <START:time> Saturday <END> boarded the """" <START:org> Trident Eight """" <END> rig and seized one of the workers . The spokesman said the other 23 people on the rig were left unharmed . Such kidnappings are common in the region , where criminal gangs are active , and where militants have demanded that the government give more of the region 's oil wealth to impoverished locals . Nearly 200 foreign workers have been abducted over the <START:time> past <END> year in the region . Most have been released unharmed , often after a ransom was paid . The attacks have forced the shutdown of oil facilities , crippling <START:geo> Nigeria <END> 's oil industry . <START:geo> U.S. <END> prosecutors have convicted five leaders of a now-defunct Muslim charity of channeling some $ 12 million to the <START:gpe> Palestinian <END> militant group <START:org> Hamas <END> . A federal court in the southwestern city of <START:geo> Dallas <END> , <START:geo> Texas <END> <START:time> Monday <END> found the men guilty of 108 separate charges . They were former leaders of the <START:org> Holy Land Foundation <END> , which organizers said collected money for poverty-stricken <START:gpe> Palestinians <END> affected by the conflict with <START:geo> Israel <END> . The group was the largest Muslim-run charity in the <START:geo> United States <END> before it was shut down by the <START:geo> U.S. <END> government in the wake of the <START:time> September 11 , 2001 <END> terrorist attacks . This was the second attempt at a trial . The first ended in <START:time> October 2007 <END> after the judge declared a mistrial . The defendants in the case denied sending money to <START:org> Hamas <END> and said the charges were politically motivated . The <START:geo> United States <END> declared <START:org> Hamas <END> a terrorist organization in <START:time> 1995 <END> , making contributions to it illegal . The <START:geo> Indus Valley <END> civilization , one of the oldest in the world and dating back at least <START:time> 5 <END> years , spread over much of what is presently <START:geo> Pakistan <END> . During the <START:time> second millennium B.C. <END> , remnants of this culture fused with the migrating Indo-Aryan peoples . The area underwent successive invasions in subsequent centuries from the <START:gpe> Persians <END> , <START:gpe> Greeks <END> , <START:gpe> Scythians <END> , <START:gpe> Arabs <END> ( who brought <START:per> Islam <END> ) , <START:gpe> Afghans <END> , and <START:gpe> Turks <END> . The <START:org> Mughal Empire <END> flourished in the <START:time> 16th and 17th <END> centuries the <START:gpe> British <END> came to dominate the region in the <START:time> 18th century <END> . The separation in <START:time> 1947 <END> of <START:gpe> British <END> <START:geo> India <END> into the <START:geo> Muslim <END> state of <START:geo> Pakistan <END> ( with <START:geo> West <END> and <START:geo> East <END> sections ) and largely <START:geo> Hindu India <END> was never satisfactorily resolved , and <START:geo> India <END> and <START:geo> Pakistan <END> fought two wars - in <START:time> 1947 <END> - <START:time> 48 and 1965 <END> - over the disputed <START:geo> Kashmir <END> territory . A third war between these countries in <START:time> 1971 - <END> in which <START:geo> India <END> capitalized on <START:geo> Islamabad <END> 's marginalization of <START:geo> Bengalis <END> in <START:gpe> Pakistani <END> <START:geo> politics <END> - resulted in <START:geo> East Pakistan <END> becoming the separate nation of <START:geo> Bangladesh <END> . In response to <START:gpe> Indian <END> nuclear weapons testing , <START:geo> Pakistan <END> conducted its own tests in <START:time> 1998 <END> . India-Pakistan relations have been rocky since the <START:time> November 2008 Mumbai <END> attacks , but both countries are taking small steps to put relations back on track . In <START:time> February 2008 <END> , <START:geo> Pakistan <END> held parliamentary elections and in <START:time> September 2008 <END> , after the resignation of former <START:per> President MUSHARRAF <END> , elected <START:per> Asif Ali ZARDARI <END> to the presidency . <START:gpe> Pakistani <END> government and military leaders are struggling to control domestic insurgents , many of whom are located in the tribal areas adjacent to the border with <START:gpe> Afghanistan <END> . <START:geo> New Caledonia <END> has about 25 % of the world 's known nickel resources . Only a small amount of the land is suitable for cultivation , and food accounts for about 20 % of imports . In addition to nickel , substantial financial support from <START:geo> France <END> - equal to more than 15 % of <START:obj> GDP <END> - and tourism are keys to the health of the economy . Substantial new investment in the nickel industry , combined with the recovery of global nickel prices , brightens the economic outlook for the next <START:time> several <END> years . Prior to the global economic crisis , <START:org> Costa Rica <END> enjoyed stable economic growth . The economy contracted 0.7 % in <START:time> 2009 <END> , but resumed growth at more than 3 % in <START:time> 2010 <END> . While the traditional agricultural exports of bananas , coffee , sugar , and beef are still the backbone of commodity export trade , a variety of industrial and specialized agricultural products have broadened export trade in <START:time> recent <END> years . High value added goods and services , including microchips , have further bolstered exports . Tourism continues to bring in foreign exchange , as <START:geo> Costa Rica <END> 's impressive biodiversity makes it a key destination for ecotourism . Foreign investors remain attracted by the country 's political stability and relatively high education levels , as well as the fiscal incentives offered in the free-trade zones and <START:geo> Costa Rica <END> has attracted one of the highest levels of foreign direct investment per capita in <START:geo> Latin America <END> . However , many business impediments , such as high levels of bureaucracy , difficulty of enforcing contracts , and weak investor protection , remain . Poverty has remained around 15-20 % for nearly <START:time> 20 <END> years , and the strong social safety net that had been put into place by the government has eroded due to increased financial constraints on government expenditures . Unlike the rest of <START:geo> Central America <END> , <START:per> Costa Rica <END> is not highly dependent on remittances as they only represent about 2 % of GDP . Immigration from <START:geo> Nicaragua <END> has increasingly become a concern for the government . The estimated 3,00,000 - 5,00,000 <START:gpe> Nicaraguans <END> in <START:per> Costa Rica <END> legally and illegally are an important source of - mostly unskilled - labor , but also place heavy demands on the social welfare system . The US-Central American-Dominican <START:geo> Republic <END> <START:obj> Free Trade Agreement <END> ( <START:obj> CAFTA-DR <END> ) entered into force on <START:time> 1 January 2009 <END> , after significant delays within the <START:org> Costa Rican <END> legislature . CAFTA-DR will likely lead to increased foreign direct investment in key sectors of the economy , including the insurance and telecommunications sectors recently opened to private investors . <START:per> President CHINCHILLA <END> is likely to push for fiscal reform in the coming year , seeking to boost revenue , possibly through revised tax legislation , to fund an increase in security services and education . The <START:gpe> Mongols <END> gained fame in the <START:time> 13th century <END> when under <START:per> Chinggis KHAAN <END> they established a huge <START:gpe> Eurasian <END> empire through conquest . After his death the empire was divided into several powerful <START:gpe> Mongol <END> states , but these broke apart in the <START:time> 14th century <END> . The <START:gpe> Mongols <END> eventually retired to their original steppe homelands and in the late <START:time> 17th century <END> came under <START:gpe> Chinese <END> rule . <START:gpe> Mongolia <END> won its independence in <START:time> 1921 <END> with Soviet backing and a Communist regime was installed in <START:time> 1924 <END> . The modern country of <START:gpe> Mongolia <END> , however , represents only part of the <START:gpe> Mongols <END> ' historical homeland more ethnic <START:gpe> Mongolians <END> live in the <START:gpe> Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region <END> in the <START:gpe> People <END> 's <START:geo> Republic of China <END> than in <START:gpe> Mongolia <END> . Following a peaceful democratic revolution , the ex-Communist <START:gpe> Mongolian <END> <START:org> People 's Revolutionary Party <END> ( <START:org> MPRP <END> ) won elections in <START:time> 1990 and 1992 <END> , but was defeated by the <START:org> Democratic Union Coalition <END> ( <START:org> DUC <END> ) in the <START:time> 1996 parliamentary election <END> . The <START:org> MPRP <END> won an overwhelming majority in the <START:time> 2000 parliamentary election <END> , but the party lost seats in the <START:time> 2004 election <END> and shared power with democratic coalition parties from <START:time> 2004 - 8 <END> . The <START:org> MPRP <END> regained a solid majority in the 2008 parliamentary elections but nevertheless formed a coalition government with the <START:org> Democratic Party <END> . In <START:time> 2010 <END> the <START:org> MPRP <END> voted to retake the name of the <START:gpe> Mongolian <END> <START:org> People 's Party <END> ( <START:org> MPP <END> ) , a name it used in the early <START:time> 1920s <END> . The prime minister and most cabinet members are <START:org> MPP <END> members . <START:gpe> Senegal <END> relies heavily on donor assistance . The country 's key export industries are phosphate mining , fertilizer production , and commercial fishing . The country is also working on iron ore and oil exploration projects . In <START:time> January 1994 <END> , <START:gpe> Senegal <END> undertook a bold and ambitious economic reform program with the support of the international donor community . Government price controls and subsidies have been steadily dismantled . After seeing its economy contract by 42767 % in <START:time> 1993 <END> , <START:gpe> Senegal <END> made an important turnaround , thanks to the reform program , with real growth in GDP averaging over 5 % annually during <START:time> 1995 - 2007 <END> . Annual inflation had been pushed down to the single digits . The country was adversely affected by the global economic downturn in <START:time> 2009 <END> and GDP growth fell below 2 % . As a member of the <START:org> West African Economic and Monetary Union <END> ( <START:org> WAEMU <END> ) , <START:gpe> Senegal <END> is working toward greater regional integration with a unified external tariff and a more stable monetary policy . High unemployment , however , continues to prompt illegal migrants to flee <START:gpe> Senegal <END> in search of better job opportunities in <START:geo> Europe <END> . Under the <START:org> IMF <END> 's <START:org> Highly Indebted Poor Countries <END> ( <START:org> HIPC <END> ) debt relief program , <START:gpe> Senegal <END> benefited from eradication of two-thirds of its bilateral , multilateral , and private-sector debt . In <START:time> 2007 <END> , <START:gpe> Senegal <END> and the <START:org> IMF <END> agreed to a new , non-disbursing , <START:org> Policy Support Initiative <END> program which was completed in <START:time> 2010 <END> . <START:gpe> Senegal <END> received its first disbursement from the $ 540 million <START:org> Millennium Challenge Account <END> compact it signed in <START:time> September 2009 <END> for infrastructure and agriculture development . In <START:time> 2010 <END> , the <START:gpe> Senegalese <END> people protested against frequent power cuts . The government pledged to expand capacity by <START:time> 2012 <END> and to promote renewable energy but until <START:gpe> Senegal <END> has more capacity , more protests are likely and economic activity will be hindered . <START:time> During <END> the year , bakers protested government price controls on bread . Foreign investment in <START:gpe> Senegal <END> is constrained by <START:gpe> Senegal <END> 's business environment , which has slipped in <START:time> recent <END> years , and by perceptions of corruption . A HART , hard pressed in the chase , hid himself beneath the large leaves of a Vine . The huntsmen , in their haste , overshot the place of his concealment . Supposing all danger to have passed , the Hart began to nibble the tendrils of the Vine . One of the huntsmen , attracted by the rustling of the leaves , looked back , and seeing the Hart , shot an arrow from his bow and struck it . The Hart , at the point of death , groaned : """" I am rightly served , for I should not have maltreated the Vine that saved me . """" A FOWLER caught a Partridge and was about to kill it . The Partridge earnestly begged him to spare his life , saying , """" Pray , master , permit me to live and I will entice many Partridges to you in recompense for your mercy to me .

While in <START:geo> Brussels <END> , the president is to meet with <START:org> European Union <END> and <START:org> NATO <END> leaders for talks expected to focus on trans-Atlantic ties , the <START:geo> Middle East <END> , and <START:geo> Iran <END> 's nuclear program .

Through fiscal discipline and sound management , <START:geo> Botswana <END> transformed itself from one of the poorest countries in the world to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of $ 13,1 in <START:time> 2010 <END> . Two major investment services rank <START:geo> Botswana <END> as the best credit risk in <START:geo> Africa <END> . Diamond mining has fueled much of the expansion and currently accounts for more than one-third of GDP , 70-80 % of export earnings , and about half of the government 's revenues . <START:geo> Botswana <END> 's heavy reliance on a single luxury export was a critical factor in the sharp economic contraction of <START:time> 2009 <END> . Tourism , financial services , subsistence farming , and cattle raising are other key sectors . Although unemployment was 42921 % in <START:time> 2007 <END> according to official reports , unofficial estimates place it closer to 40 % . The prevalence of <START:org> HIV / AIDS <END> is second highest in the world and threatens <START:geo> Botswana <END> 's impressive economic gains . An expected leveling off in diamond mining production within the next <START:time> two decades <END> overshadows long-term prospects . <START:gpe> Kyrgyzstan <END> is a poor , mountainous country with a dominant agricultural sector . Cotton , tobacco , wool , and meat are the main agricultural products , although only tobacco and cotton are exported in any quantity . Industrial exports include gold , mercury , uranium , natural gas , and electricity . The economy depends heavily on gold exports - mainly from output at the <START:geo> Kumtor <END> gold mine . Following independence , <START:gpe> Kyrgyzstan <END> was progressive in carrying out market reforms , such as an improved regulatory system and land reform . <START:gpe> Kyrgyzstan <END> was the first <START:org> Commonwealth of Independent States <END> ( <START:org> CIS <END> ) country to be accepted into the <START:org> World Trade Organization <END> . Much of the government 's stock in enterprises has been sold . Drops in production had been severe after the breakup of the <START:org> Soviet Union <END> in <START:time> December 1991 <END> , but by <START:time> mid-1995 <END> , production began to recover and exports began to increase . In <START:time> 2005 <END> , the <START:org> BAKIEV <END> government and international financial institutions initiated a comprehensive medium-term poverty reduction and economic growth strategy . <START:per> Bishkek <END> agreed to pursue much needed tax reform and , in <START:time> 2006 <END> , became eligible for the heavily indebted poor countries ( <START:org> HIPC <END> ) initiative . The government made steady strides in controlling its substantial fiscal deficit , nearly closing the gap between revenues and expenditures in <START:time> 2006 <END> , before boosting expenditures more than 20 % in <START:time> 2007 - 8 <END> . <START:obj> GDP <END> grew about 8 % annually in <START:time> 2007 - 8 <END> , partly due to higher gold prices internationally , but slowed to 42769 % in <START:time> 2009 <END> . The overthrow of President <START:per> BAKIEV <END> in <START:time> April , 2010 <END> and subsequent ethnic clashes left hundreds dead and damaged infrastructure . Shrinking trade and agricultural production , as well as political instability , caused GDP to contract about 42799 % in <START:time> 2010 <END> . The fiscal deficit widened to 11 % of <START:obj> GDP <END> , reflecting significant increases in crisis-related spending , including both rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure and bank recapitalization . Progress in reconstruction , fighting corruption , restructuring domestic industry , and attracting foreign aid and investment are key to future growth . This island economy suffers from a poor natural resource base , including serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of long-term drought and poor soil for agriculture on several of the islands . The economy is service oriented with commerce , transport , tourism , and public services accounting for about three-fourths of GDP . Although about 40 % of the population lives in rural areas , the share of food production in GDP is low . About 82 % of food must be imported . The fishing potential , mostly lobster and tuna , is not fully exploited . <START:geo> Cape Verde <END> annually runs a high trade deficit financed by foreign aid and remittances from its large pool of emigrants remittances supplement GDP by more than 20 % . Despite the lack of resources , sound economic management has produced steadily improving incomes . Continued economic reforms are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy . Future prospects depend heavily on the maintenance of aid flows , the encouragement of tourism , remittances , and the momentum of the government 's development program . <START:geo> Cape Verde <END> became a member of the <START:org> WTO <END> in <START:time> July 2008 <END> . The islands , which have large bird and seal populations , lie approximately 1 km east of the <START:geo> Falkland Islands <END> and have been under <START:gpe> British <END> administration since <START:time> 1908 - <END> except for a brief period in <START:time> 1982 <END> when <START:geo> Argentina <END> occupied them . <START:geo> Grytviken <END> , on <START:geo> South Georgia <END> , was a <START:time> 19th <END> and early <START:time> 20th century <END> whaling station . <START:per> Famed explorer Ernest SHACKLETON <END> stopped there in <START:time> 1914 <END> en route to his ill-fated attempt to cross <START:geo> Antarctica <END> on foot . He returned some <START:time> 20 <END> months <START:time> later <END> with a few companions in a small boat and arranged a successful rescue for the rest of his crew , stranded off the <START:geo> Antarctic Peninsula <END> . He died in <START:time> 1922 <END> on a subsequent expedition and is buried in <START:geo> Grytviken <END> . <START:time> Today <END> , the station houses scientists from the <START:gpe> British <END> <START:geo> Antarctic <END> Survey . Recognizing the importance of preserving the marine stocks in adjacent waters , the <START:org> UK <END> , in <START:time> 1993 <END> , extended the exclusive fishing zone from 12 nm to 200 nm around each island . A CAT , hearing that the Birds in a certain aviary were ailing dressed himself up as a physician , and , taking his cane and a bag of instruments becoming his profession , went to call on them . He knocked at the door and inquired of the inmates how they all did , saying that if they were ill , he would be happy to prescribe for them and cure them . They replied , """" We are all very well , and shall continue so , if you will only be good enough to go away , and leave us as we are . """" A NIGHTINGALE , sitting aloft upon an oak and singing according to his wont , was seen by a Hawk who , being in need of food , swooped down and seized him . The Nightingale , about to lose his life , earnestly begged the Hawk to let him go , saying that he was not big enough to satisfy the hunger of a Hawk who , if he wanted food , ought to pursue the larger birds . The Hawk , interrupting him , said : """" I should indeed have lost my senses if I should let go food ready in my hand , for the sake of pursuing birds which are not yet even within sight . """" A Peacock once placed a petition before <START:per> Juno <END> desiring to have the voice of a nightingale in addition to his other attractions but <START:per> Juno <END> refused his request . When he persisted , and pointed out that he was her favourite bird , she said : """" Be content with your lot one can not be first in everything . """" A STATE Official carrying off the <START:geo> Dome of the Capitol <END> met the Ghost of his predecessor , who had come out of his political grave to warn him that God saw him . As the place of meeting was lonely and the time <START:time> midnight <END> , the <START:org> State Official <END> set down the <START:geo> Dome of the Capitol <END> , and commanded the supposed traveller to throw up his hands . The Ghost replied that he had not eaten them , and while he was explaining the situation another <START:org> State Official <END> silently added the dome to his own collection . The <START:geo> United States <END> ' top law enforcement official says the recent terrorist bombings in <START:geo> Britain <END> and <START:geo> Egypt <END> could be the work of <START:org> al-Qaida <END> . Attorney <START:per> General Alberto Gonzales <END> cautioned that officials are still investigating the bombings , which together killed some 140 people . But in an interview with <START:org> CNN <END> television , <START:per> Mr. Gonzales <END> said the <START:time> July 7 <END> attack on <START:geo> London <END> 's transit system and the <START:time> July 23 <END> bombing at <START:geo> Egypt <END> 's Sharm-el-Sheik resort both have the appearance of <START:org> al-Qaida <END> involvement . Groups that say they are affiliated with <START:org> al-Qaida <END> have claimed responsibility for the attacks . <START:time> Sunday <END> <START:org> 's Washington Post <END> cites intelligence officials and terrorism experts as saying that <START:per> Osama bin Laden <END> or his aides may have sponsored the two operations from afar .
